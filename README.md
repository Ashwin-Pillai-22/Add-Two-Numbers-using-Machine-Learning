**Overview**:  This project demonstrates how to use a machine learning model to perform the simple arithmetic task of adding two numbers. While adding numbers is a basic operation, this project showcases the potential and versatility of machine learning techniques in handling various types of problems.

**Features**:
1. Train a machine learning model to learn the addition of two numbers.
2. Predict the sum of two numbers using the trained model.
3. Simple and easy-to-understand implementation for educational purposes.
   
**Requirements**:
1. Python 3.6+
2. Scikit-learn or TensorFlow or any other preferred machine learning library
3. NumPy
4. Pandas
5. Matplotlib
6. Joblib
7. Jupyter Notebook (optional, for interactive development)
8. Customtkinter
9. Tkinter
